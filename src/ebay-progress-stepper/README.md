## Components

### EbayProgressStepper

This is the container of the wizard stepper and you can define the direction of the stepper and pass properties to
customize the layout (`className` or `style`)

#### Props

Name | Type | Stateful | Required | Description
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
`direction` | String | No | No | Either `column` or `row` (default). Will display stepper as a vertical column or horizontal row.
`defaultState` | String | Yes | No | `complete`: all items will be in `complete` state by default, `upcoming`:all items will be in `upcoming` state, `attention`: current item will be shown as blocked. Otherwise, default state (`active`) will change items based on the current item (defaults to first step if not set).

### EbayProgressStep

This component is used to render each step. It renders an icon, a title and a text label.

#### Props

Name | Type | Stateful | Required | Description
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
`current` | Boolean | No | No | The current step. Only first step that has this property will be considered current. All steps before will be rendered as complete, and all after will render as upcoming. If not present on any step, then will render based on `defaultState` property

### EbayProgressTitle

The bolded title for each step. Will be rendered in an `h4` by default.

#### Props

Name | Type | Stateful | Required | Description
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
`as` | String | No | No | HTML tag to use instead of `h4`
